<!-- `window.open()` is a JavaScript method used to open a new browser window or tab programmatically. It takes several parameters, but the most commonly used ones are the URL of the page to open and the name of the window. Here's the basic syntax:

```javascript
window.open(URL, windowName, windowFeatures);
```

- `URL` (optional): The URL of the page to open. If not specified, a blank page will be opened.
- `windowName` (optional): The name of the new window. If a window with the same name already exists, the content will be loaded into that window. If not specified, a new window with a default name (usually "_blank") will be opened.
- `windowFeatures` (optional): A comma-separated list of features for the new window, such as size, position, scrollbars, etc.

Here's an example:

```javascript
window.open("https://example.com", "Example", "width=600,height=400");
```

This code will open a new window with the content of "https://example.com", named "Example", and with a width of 600 pixels and a height of 400 pixels. -->
